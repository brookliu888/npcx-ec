+-----------+------------+-------------------------------------+

Other hardware features are not currently supported by Zephyr (at the moment)

The default configuration can be found in the defconfig file:
``boards/arm/npcx9m6f_poc/npcx9m6f_evb_defconfig``


Connections and IOs
===================

Nuvoton to provide the schematic for this board.

System Clock
============

The NPCX9M6F MCU is configured to use the 90Mhz internal oscillator with the
on-chip PLL to generate a resulting EC clock rate of 15 MHz. See Processor clock
control register (chapter 4 in user manual)

Serial Port
===========

UART1 is configured for serial logs.


Programming and Debugging
*************************

This board comes with a Cortex ETM port which facilitates tracing and debugging
using a single physical connection.  In addition, it comes with sockets for
JTAG only sessions.

Flashing
========

Build application as usual for the ``npcx9m6f_poc`` board, and flash
using Servo V2, Î¼Servo, or Servo V4 (CCD). See the
`Chromium EC Flashing Documentation`_ for more information.


Debugging
=========

Use JTAG/SWD with a J-Link
